    - "1"
    - Some 
    - 2 cups
    - 1&frasl;2 cup
    - 2 tbsp
    - 1&frasl;4 cup
    - 1 clove 
    - 1&frasl;4 cup
    - 1&frasl;4 tsp
    - 1&frasl;4 tsp

instructions:
  - Preheat oven to 425 degrees.
  - "Pesto prep: Combine basil, pine nuts, lemon juice, parmesan, garlic, olive, oil, salt, and pepper. Blend to a paste."
  - "Flatbread prep: Cover flatbread with pesto, thinly sliced tomatoes, mozzarella, and more grated parmesan."
  - Cook until golden brown.
  - Serve.

notes:
  - Use a flatbread that you imagine to be enough for 2 people.
  - I don't really know what "2 cups of basil" means. You will likely end up with more pesto than is apporpriate to put on your flatbread.
  - Freshly grating your parmesan, here and in general, is a great way to improve your life.
