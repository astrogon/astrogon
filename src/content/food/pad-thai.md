    - Garlic (minced)
    - Ginger (grated)
    - Brown sugar
    - Soy sauce (low sodium)

  qty:

    - 1 bunch
    - 6 stalks
    - 4 cloves
    - 1&frasl;4 cup
    - 1&frasl;3 cup
    - 1&frasl;2 cup
    - 1&frasl;4 cup
    - 1&frasl;4 cup
    - 1 tbsp
    - 1&frasl;4 cup

instructions:
  - "Stir fry prep: chop and combine garlic, ginger, cilantro, green onion, and any other desired ingredients*."
  - "Noodle prep: cook noodles al dente; rinse and drain well."
  - "Sauce prep: combine brown sugar, peanut butter, soy sauce, lime juice, and sriracha in a bowl."
  - "Garnish prep: optionally chop peanuts/limes/cilantro and set aside for serving."
  - Saute stir fry ingredients in a large pan; account for differences in cook time among ingredients.
  - Add noodles to the pan, combine thoroughly.
  - Add sauce, combine thoroughly.
  - Remove from heat when sauce is cooked in to your liking.
  - Serve.

notes:
  - "*Other desired ingredients may include spinach, broccoli, bell pepper, baby corn, etc."
  - Steps 1-4 can be parallelized, and that's where most of the work is.
  - Cilantro is really great.
  - I recommend dividing the veggies that will saute quickly from those that will slowly.
  - Keep the soy sauce and lime juice handy, you may want more flavor toward the end.
