description: This is just some tame bruschetta. Truly the poor-man's mini pizza, though simultaneously a classy appetizer.

ingredients:
  list:
    - Baguette
    - Roma tomatoes
    - Basil
    - Parmesan
    - Balsamic vinegar
    - Olive oil

instructions:
  - Preheat the oven to 400 F.
  - Dice tomatoes to the desired size, add them to a bowl.
  - Cut the basil to shreds, mix it in with the tomatoes.
  - Add balsamic vinegar to the bowl and let it soak 5-60 minutes.
  - Cut the baguette into slices around 1cm thick.
  - Lightly coat both sides of each slice in olive oil, and place them on a baking sheet.
  - Spoon an even amount of tomato stuff onto each slice, and place in the oven until golden.
  - Sprinkle each piece with parmesan, then give it a couple more minutes in the oven.
  - Serve, topping with balsamic glaze and spicy honey to taste.

notes:
  - Watch out for the pieces sticking to the baking sheet. This can be ameliorated by nudging the pieces of bruschetta as they bake.
  - You may be tempted to add salt to the tomato stuff, but the balsamic will do plenty.
  - It's nice to get a little balsamic vinegar in each spoonful for the baguette, but it's easy to get the bread soggy with it.
