    - some
    - some

instructions:
  - Boil pierogis; remove wheh floating.
  - Chop onion (not too small).
  - Sautee onion lightly, they should need more time than the pierogis.
  - Add pierogis to pan.
  - When close to done, turn down the heat and add lemon, thyme, salt, and pepper.
  - Cook until golden.
  - Serve into a bowl, top with parmesan and any additional salt, pepper, or lemon juice to taste.

notes:
  - I recommend the pierogis from Fresh Thyme, given their quality and price.
  - A good nonstick pan is important for avoiding a ripped-noodle potatoey mess.
  - Covering the pan for a period as soon as lemon is added will make it absorb better.
