ingredients:
  list:
    - Pizza dough
    - Pizza sauce
    - Low moisture mozarella
    - Basil
    - Balsamic glaze
    - Spicy honey
  qty:
    - 8 oz
    - some
    - 4 oz
    - some
    - some
    - some

instructions:
  - Prepare dough as instructed.
  - Cover the flattened dough with a modest layer of sauce.
  - Add desired amount of basil, then mozarella (less than 1&frasl;2 cm thick), and put in oven.
  - When the pizza looks almost done, pull out, add balsamic glaze and honey, and put it back in until finished.
  - Pull out, slice up, serve.

notes:
  - I like to hide the basil under the mozarella so it doesn't burn crisp in the oven.
  - I usually also add shredded parmesan and pepperoni. Top with whatever you'd like.
  - Trader Joe's has a really great herby pizza dough, 1 bag is enough for 2 personal pizzas.
  - Joe's is also a great source for the rest of the ingredients, especially the balsamic and honey.
