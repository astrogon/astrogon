prep_time: 25
servings: 1

ingredients:
  list:
    - Large croissant
    - Bacon
    - Roma tomato
    - Spinach
    - Mayonaise
  qty:
    - "1"
    - 5 oz
    - "1"
    - some
    - some

instructions:
  - Preheat the oven to about 400 F, or whatever your bacon pack says.
  - For the bacon, use a walled baking sheet covered in a sheet of tin foil, with edged turned up to form walls.
  - Lay out the bacon and put it in the oven. Take out when cooked to the desired level of crisp.
  - Using a bread knife, slice the croissant for sandwiching. Optionally, remove some of the inner bread.
  - Slice up the tomato to the desired thickness.
  - When bacon is ready, give it a moment to cool on a separate plate with a paper towel to absorb grease.
  - Optionally, heat the croissant in the microwave for 10-15 seconds.
  - Lay out as much mayo over the crossant as desired, add bacon, then tomato, then spinach.
  - Serve.

notes:
  - Realistically you could probably handle 1 1/2 of these, then using an even 8 oz of bacon. 2 smaller croissants may be preferred here.
  - In my opinion, avocado doesn't add much to the experience, but you're welcome to try.
  - Replacing the mayo with a quick little sriracha mayo, or even a pesto mayo, could be worth a shot.
